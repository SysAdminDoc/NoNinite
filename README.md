# NoNinite: Winget & Chocolatey Script Generator

**NoNinite** is a playful, alternative take on [ninite.com](https://ninite.com/) created mainly for my own workflow.  
Instead of downloading classic Ninite installers, this userscript keeps the familiar `ninite.com` domain but transforms it into a modern package management tool using **[Winget](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/package-manager/winget/)** and **[Chocolatey](https://chocolatey.org/)**.

With NoNinite, you can:
- Browse and search a large catalog of applications (many more than standard Ninite).
- Quickly select apps and generate install scripts for Winget, Chocolatey, or both.
- Use presets and stacks to speed up your workflow.
- Customize script generation options (silent installs, scope, bootstrap script, etc.).
- Export or import your presets and configuration.

## Why I Made This
Ninite has been a massive help to me for many years and their service played a huge role in me becoming the IT technician I am today.  
This project is not about replacing or competing with Ninite. I wish them nothing but the best.  

NoNinite is mostly a personal experiment to help me discourage my own use of Ninite installers and instead adopt modern packaging standards that are more flexible for scripting and automation.

## How It Works
When installed, the userscript runs on `https://ninite.com/` and replaces its functionality with a custom interface:
1. Select applications from categories or search.
2. Choose your package manager(s): Winget and/or Chocolatey.
3. Configure install options in settings.
4. Generate a script (PowerShell bootstrap or plain commands) you can run anywhere.

## Installation
You will need a userscript manager in your browser:
- **[Violentmonkey](https://violentmonkey.github.io/)**
- **[Tampermonkey](https://www.tampermonkey.net/)**
